# When installing packages during later steps, the Fedora Docker
# images we are using (geerlingguy/docker-fedora32-ansible:latest and
# cisagov/docker-fedora33-ansible:latest) can throw sporadic errors
# like:
#
# No such file or directory: '/var/cache/dnf/metadata_lock.pid'
#
# Our fix is to ensure that systemd finishes initializing before
# continuing on to the converge tasks.  For details see:
