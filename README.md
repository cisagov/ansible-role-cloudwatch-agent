[![CodeQL](https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-cloudwatch-agent/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-cloudwatch-agent/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

This is an Ansible role that installs and enables the [Amazon
CloudWatch
Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html)
systemd service.

Note that for an EC2 instance to successfully run the CloudWatch
Agent, it must be started with an instance role that includes the
"CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy" policy.  See
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.html)
for more details.

See
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html)
for details on configuring the Amazon CloudWatch Agent.

Note that this Ansible role makes use of the [`json_patch` Ansible
module](https://github.com/ParticleDecay/ansible-jsonpatch), which is
proposed for inclusion into the main Ansible project.  (For more
information about what JSON Patch is, see
[here](http://jsonpatch.com/).)  A copy of the relevant piece of
Python code from that repository is included in the `library`
directory, so there is no extra action required by the user.
